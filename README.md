# book-search-engine

## Description
Using starter code this project allowed me to create a a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API that was refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. This application allows users to search for books and save books by signing up or loging in.
